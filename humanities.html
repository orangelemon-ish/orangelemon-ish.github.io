<h1>Humanities</h1>
	<br>
	<p class="intro">Humanities: quite possibly the funniest, most enjoyable, most stressful, most interactive class ever. An English-history combo, this class was (is) taught by two of the most wonderful teachers and people ever. Their bromance never fails to make me smile. Neither does their flirting - even though they're both married. They made the class incredibly interesting, informative, and hilarious and this is probably the class I'll miss the most going into sophomore year. I simultaneously dreaded and eagerly anticipated going to this 52-person class every day, terrified at the prospect of a timed write, which, in the words of my English teacher, shouldn't be all that surprising, as "in an English class, students should expect to be asked to write intelligently about their reading." It was this class that had me staying up till three in the morning to finish essays, because I couldn't stand the thought of disappointing my teachers. And it was this class that taught me how to think.<br><br>Below, you can find some of my best works from throughout the year, mostly in the form of writing. Please bear in mind that the year was cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic, and as such, I have less to show for that time.</p>

			<h4>October 3, 2019</h4>
			<p>Our first unit in English covered the nature of comics. To help illustrate this, we read <em>Maus I</em> and <em>II.</em> Over both novels, a common theme I noticed was the excess or lack of family obligation, defined as the pressure put on a person by their family to do certain things. This essay explores that theme in <em>Maus</em> and discusses its effects. This was my first "real" literary analysis essay.</p>

				<h4>November 11, 2019</h4>
				<p>After reading Oedipus, we were tasked with writing a personal essay about the factors that have shaped our lives. Personal Essays have generaly been hard for me, as a) my life's kind of boring, and b) I don't really remember most of it. So, in the past, most of my personal essays have been about That Time I Broke My Wrist. I must have used that one for a solid four years, honestly. I was getting sort of tried of writing about the same thing over and over, so I tried something new. Indian-ness. I didn't think it would go so well (I legit had a meltdown in the hallway about this essay), but somehow, I ended up getting a 100. :)</p>

				<h4>January 10, 2020</h4>
				<p>Honestly, this book gave me nightmares. Not because it was scary (it wasn't), but because of how very applicable it was to, well, everything. I'd just be listening to the radio on a road trip or something, and then be like "hey, that's kind of like when Cassius was talking about . . . " and force my entire family to listen to me talk about <em>Julius Caesar.</em> Not that they payed attention. Anyways, here it is. The culmination of my (in-school, at least) work with <em>Caesar.</em></p>

				<h4>January 16, 2020</h4>
				<p>This was a timed write we did for history to finish up the Rome/<em>Caesar</em> unit. We had talked a lot about the factors that caused the fall of Rome, and a little about the foundations on which America was built. In the timed write, we addressed whether the US had begun to mirror Rome in that it was about to collapse/was already collapsing. Little did we know what was to come! <br><em>Edit:</em> Looking back on this after Jan 6..... well, it's certainly a bit ironic.</p>

				<h4>October-November 2019</h4>
				<p>Acting Civilized was a project we did on the social studies side of things. We were tasked with enacting real change on a social issue of our choice. My group chose sexual assault, and we held a self-defense class so people could better learn how to defend themselves against assault.</p>

				<h3><a href="https://www.wevideo.com/view/1667807473">WDPBTTAT Project</a></h3>
				<h4>April 2020</h4>
				<p>"WDPBTTAT" stands for "Why Do People Believe Things That Aren't True," and in the project, we researched exactly that. We studied the mechanisms that caused people to believe in things like conspiracies, and why it's such a big deal at all. My group's final project was a 25-minute video, linked above, that I have to say is quite funny.</p>

				<h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w35qifSQIPlfVO7CPfVY7H8OvxuvcmGBi3tdjWIVKhQ/edit?usp=sharing"><em>Lord of the Flies</em> Notesheet</a></h3>
				<h4>May 2020</h4>
				<p><em>Lord of the Flies</em> was actually a really great, albeit disturbing book. I genuinely enjoyed it. This is my notesheet for the book, in which I take note of important events and quotations. It's incredibly tedious, but also pretty useful, as I can just pull from there during essay/paragraph-writing time. During this unit, we wrote a multitude of analysis paragraphs on both the book itself and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDgMVk7Broc&t=1158s">film adaptation</a>. This notesheet contains both my notes and the my analysis paragraphs. NOTE: Beware of Sarcasm!</p>

			<p>Near the end of the school year, we studied various philosophers. This notesheet summarizes their beliefs, as well as my own take on them.</p>
