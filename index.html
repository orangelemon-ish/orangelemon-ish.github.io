		<p>Hello! This is Avni Gupta. I'm a somewhat disheveled gremlin with far too many interests to be counted.</p>

<h2>Passions</h2>
<p class="intro">Of passions I have many, including but not limited to cybersecurity, being destroyed by my little brother at solving Rubik's Cubes, and eating chocolate.</p>

		<h3>Reading</h3>
		<img class="thingimg" src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.pexels.com%2Fphotos%2F1387022%2Fpexels-photo-1387022.jpeg%3Fcs%3Dsrgb%26dl%3Dbook-aesthetic-books-old-books-1387022.jpg%26fm%3Djpg&f=1&nofb=1">
		<p class="thingtxt">I've loved to read books of all sorts since I was a kid, though my favorite genre is fantasy - I love stories with a sense of whimsy. Some of my go-tos include <em>Six of Crows</em> by Leigh Bardugo, <em>The Book Thief</em> by Mark Zusak, and <em>The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue</em> by V.E. Schwab.</p>

		<p class="thingtxt">Bioinformatics is a field that uses computer and information science in order to analyze biological data. It's a pretty broad field, including topics from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_alignment" target="_blank">sequence alignment</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_structure_prediction" target="_blank">predicting the structure of proteins.</a> <br><br>After taking a UChicagao course on computational biology, I learned several of the techniques

		<h3>Music</h3>
		<img class="thingimg" src="https://assets.wallpapersin4k.org/uploads/2017/04/Music-Desktop-Wallpapers-22.jpg">
		<p class="thingtxt">I'm also a musician - my chosen instrument is the flute, though I'd love to learn the cello if I ever find the time. I play in my school's band, as well as in local music festivals and just for fun.<br><br>Listening to music is also a favorite pastime of mine. My taste in music is 70s-80s with the occasional 2010s song thrown in. Favorites include anything by the Beatles and Queen, "Piano Man," and "Hotel California," about which I have actually written an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18NUermKSKUfjmGp1yUevFs9IT-yU2mlu9ArFJf1P1vY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">analysis paragraph.</a></p>

		<h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
		<img class="thingimg" src="https://technofaq.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cyber-security-1024x576.jpg">
		<p class="thingtxt">I also love learning about cybersecurity, particularly how computers and the internet work and how to exploit vulnerabilities within them. I find learning about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things" target="_blank">IoT (Internet of Things)</a> particularly fascinating.</p>
