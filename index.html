		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Hello! This is Avni Gupta. I'm a somewhat disheveled gremlin with far too many interests to be counted.</p>

<h2>Passions</h2>
<p class="intro">Of passions I have many, including but not limited to cybersecurity, being destroyed by my little brother at solving Rubik's Cubes, and eating chocolate.</p>

		<h3>Reading</h3>
		<img class="thingimg" src="photos/bookshelf.jpg">
		<p class="thingtxt">I've loved to read books of all sorts since I was a kid, though my favorite genre is fantasy - I love stories with a sense of whimsy. Some of my go-tos include <em>Six of Crows</em> by Leigh Bardugo, <em>Hamnet</em> by Maggie O'Farrell, and <em>The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue</em> by V.E. Schwab.</p>

		<h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
		<img class="thingimg" src="https://technofaq.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cyber-security-1024x576.jpg">
		<p class="thingtxt">My latest major interest is cybersecurity and all its aspects, from programming to computer architecture to networking. I'm especially interested by the Internet of Things. <br><br> Currently, I've been named a National Cyber Scholar by the <a href="https://www.nationalcyberscholarship.org/">National Cyber Scholarship Foundation</a>, and am working towards my <a href="https://www.giac.org/certifications/foundational-cybersecurity-technologies-gfact/">GFACT</a> certification in the industry.</p>

		<h3>Gardening</h3>
		<img class="thingimg" src="photos/evelyn.jpg">
		<p class="thingtxt">I adore gardening in all varieties, from vegetable garden plots to keeping houseplants. Currently, I have 7 plants - two kinds of cacti, 3 succulents, an aloe, and a peperomia. In addition to volunteering at both the high school and the teen center's community gardens, I cultivate an annual vegetable garden in my backyard, growing tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, squash, and sometimes corn. <br><br> <em>Left: my moon cactus, Evelyn</em></p>

		<h3>Neuroscience and Psychology</h3>
		<img class="thingimg" src="https://assets.wallpapersin4k.org/uploads/2017/04/Music-Desktop-Wallpapers-22.jpg">
		<p class="thingtxt">The inner workings of the brain fascinate me. I love learning what makes people tick, and understanding how everything from brain structure to environment can influence that.</p>
