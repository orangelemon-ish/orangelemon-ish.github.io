<h1>Misc</h1>
<br>
<p class="intro">Besides Humanities, we did relatively few projects. Because of this, I'm combining work from my other classes here. You won't find work from all of my classes, however, as not all of them involved displayable projects.</p>

	<h4>Spring 2020</h4>
	<p>During ~pandemic classes~, the band director asked us to analyze a favorite song of ours. I'm fairly sure he meant in terms of music, but given all the literary analysis I had been doing, I couldn't leave it at that. <em>Hotel California</em>, I concluded, was an allegory for society's entrapment of the individual. Pretty good for some really high musicians!</p>
