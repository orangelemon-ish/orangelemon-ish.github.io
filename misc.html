<h1>Misc</h1>
<br>
<p class="intro">Besides Humanities, we did relatively few projects. Because of this, I'm combining work from my other classes here. You won't find work from all of my classes, however, as not all of them involved displayable projects.</p>

<h2>Bio</h2>
<p class="intro">This class was rigorous, stressful, and taught by a teacher notorious for her toughness. It was one of my favorites. Every single day, we'd inevitably get off-track talking about something mildly related to what we were supposed to be learning about. In this way, I learned not only the actual curriculum, but also tons of random biology facts.</p>

	<h4>June 2020</h4>
	<p>Our last unit in bio was ecology, so this project doubled as the end-of-year project, as well as the culmination of the ecology unit. My partner and I both kind of dislike ecology, preferring to study biological processes on the molecular scale. So, we asked our teacher if we could focus on immunology instead. This project explores the basics of immunology, as well as its extensive connections to the COVID-19 pandemic. We may have gone a bit overboard, considering our teacher said that our project was what she expected from AP Bio students. Oops.</p>

	<h4>Spring 2020</h4>
	<p>During ~pandemic classes~, the band director asked us to analyze a favorite song of ours. I'm fairly sure he meant in terms of music, but given all the literary analysis I had been doing, I couldn't leave it at that. <em>Hotel California</em>, I concluded, was an allegory for society's entrapment of the individual. Pretty good for some really high musicians!</p>
