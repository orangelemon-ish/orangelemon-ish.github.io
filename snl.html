    <h1>Self-Navigating <br>Expert Learner</h1>

    <br>

    <p class="intro">A Self-Navigating Expert Learner refers to a student who can guide their own learning. They can choose a direction in a project and carry it out without extensive guidance. They are, also, self-motivated in their learning, seeking new information even when not required.</p>

        <h4>January 2021 - Eleventh Grade - Neurobiology</h4>
        <p>To cap off my independent study in neurobiology, I chose to explore how time is processed in the human brain. This is a fairly under-researched area, and we don't yet fully understand how exactly people percieve the passage of time, and the fully neural pathways that allow them to do so. In the project, I started out with an exploration of biological clocks, like <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1237TZcoWjAsOdlxWJIClN3b5N3yPPFJvMraHOnFYPYA/edit#slide=id.gf941533d8d_0_0" target="_blank">circadian rhythms</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1237TZcoWjAsOdlxWJIClN3b5N3yPPFJvMraHOnFYPYA/edit#slide=id.g10d3f31f5fe_0_18" target="_blank">hippocampal time cells</a>, and then moved into how the brain experiences the passage of time. I then focused on how time perception is altered during traumatic events, and specifically during the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1237TZcoWjAsOdlxWJIClN3b5N3yPPFJvMraHOnFYPYA/edit#slide=id.g10d3f31f5fe_0_112" target="_blank">COVID-19 pandemic</a>. <br><br>
            
        To create this project, I first had to research several topics in neurobiology, and choose one to focus on that I was not only interested in, but had enough of a body of research to allow me to create a thorough product. Additionally, this allowed me to develop my research skills, as I had to delve into research papers and articles on a relatively less well-documented topic and then synthesize bits and pieces of each source into the final product.</p>
