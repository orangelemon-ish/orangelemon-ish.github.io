    <h1>Self-Navigating Expert Learner</h1>

    <br>

    <p class="intro">A Self-Navigating Expert Learner refers to a student who can guide their own learning. They can choose a direction in a project and carry it out without extensive guidance. They are, also, self-motivated in their learning, seeking new information even when not required.</p>

        <h4>November 2021 - Eleventh Grade - Neurobiology</h4>
        <p>As part of my independent study in neurobiology, I had to make a presentation on one of the senses. Instead of choosing one of the traditional five, I decided to explore proprioception, or your sense of your own body's location in space. This project allowed me to develop my research skills, as I had to delve into research papers and articles on a relatively less well-documented topic.</p>
