<h1>Ninth Grade</h1>
<br>
<p>Although it isn't all that 'new' anymore, this project explores the ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically altered our lives and lifestyles.
<br><br>
As a freshman in high school, I've had two completely separate experiences - one before and one after the pandemic. Before, I went to school every day, laughing with my friends and stressing about the latest essay or test. I enjoyed my classes, regardless of the daily midnight bedtime they warranted. After school, I went to karate, swim practices, clubs like debate and astronomy, staying after school from sometimes six hours.
<br><br>
Now, that's all gone. School has been reduced to a couple online assignments a day, which I finish in about an hour. I only see my friends through Hangouts calls, a sad attempt to imitate in-person interaction. My clubs have all but ended, and sports practices happen over Zoom once or twice a week. 
<br><br>
But then, this pandemic has also been a breath of fresh air (how ironic). I no longer have hours of schoolwork, leaving time for me to pursue coding projects that I've put on hold. I've been learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, and Python, and even joined Hack Club, and international organization of student coders. I've also been trying to enhance my academics by getting a head start on my summer work and on next year's curriculum. And, for the first time in almost nine months, I have time to pick up a book and read.</p>
