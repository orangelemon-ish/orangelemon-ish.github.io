    <h2>Contemporary Multiliterate Scholar</h2>
    <p class="intro">The Contemporary Multiliterate Scholar, according to my school's Portrait of a Graduate, "demonstrates skills in contemporary and classic literacies, a broad knowledge in a variety of disciplines and a commitment to continuous learning." Essentially, it means being well-rounded, being able to express and highlight your learning in a variety of subjects through a variety of methods.</p>

        <h3><em>The Metamorphosis</em> Video</h3>
        <h4>June 2022 - Eleventh Grade - AP English Language</h4>
        <p>As a final project for my AP Lang class, my class decided to make a three-episode adaptation of Franz Kafka's classic, <em>The Metamorphosis</em>. <br><br>This project involved several different skills, from screenwriting to literary analysis to acting. Having to adapt the novel to the screen brought with it a host of challenges, as we had to remain true to the story's meaning while putting our own original spin on it. This involved first the ability to analyze the novel, and then the ability to explain it clearly. As such, we made</p>

        <h4>Tenth Grade - Selected World Literature</h4>
        <p>Throughout my sophomore year, my English teacher had us complete a yearlong project reflecting on life in th midst of a pandemic. This reflection took the form of various kinds of writing, from formal to creative, as well as photography, poetry, and group discussions. <br><br>This reflection was a sort of catharsis, helping me process and come to terms with remote school, missed opportunities, and pandemic life. Over the course of the year, I was able to reflect on pandemic life and move beyond the negative to explore the importance of small things, focusing on the joy still present in the world.</p>

        <h4>January 2021 - Eleventh Grade - Neurobiology</h4>
        <p>To cap off my independent study in neurobiology, I chose to explore how time is processed in the human brain. This is a fairly under-researched area, and we don't yet fully understand how exactly people percieve the passage of time, and the fully neural pathways that allow them to do so. In the project, I started out with an exploration of biological clocks, like <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1237TZcoWjAsOdlxWJIClN3b5N3yPPFJvMraHOnFYPYA/edit#slide=id.gf941533d8d_0_0" target="_blank">circadian rhythms</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1237TZcoWjAsOdlxWJIClN3b5N3yPPFJvMraHOnFYPYA/edit#slide=id.g10d3f31f5fe_0_18" target="_blank">hippocampal time cells</a>, and then moved into how the brain experiences the passage of time. I then focused on how time perception is altered during traumatic events, and specifically during the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1237TZcoWjAsOdlxWJIClN3b5N3yPPFJvMraHOnFYPYA/edit#slide=id.g10d3f31f5fe_0_112" target="_blank">COVID-19 pandemic</a>. <br><br>
            
        To create this project, I first had to research several topics in neurobiology, and choose one to focus on that I was not only interested in, but had enough of a body of research to allow me to create a thorough product. Additionally, this allowed me to develop my research skills, as I had to delve into research papers and articles on a relatively less well-documented topic and then synthesize bits and pieces of each source into the final product.</p>
