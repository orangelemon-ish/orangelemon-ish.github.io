        <h4>Tenth Grade - Selected World Literature</h4>
        <p>Throughout my sophomore year, my English teacher had us complete a yearlong project reflecting on life in th midst of a pandemic. This reflection took the form of various kinds of writing, from formal to creative, as well as photography, poetry, and group discussions. <br><br>This reflection was a sort of catharsis, helping me process and come to terms with remote school, missed opportunities, and pandemic life. Over the course of the year, I was able to reflect on pandemic life and move beyond the negative to explore the importance of small things, focusing on the joy still present in the world.</p>
