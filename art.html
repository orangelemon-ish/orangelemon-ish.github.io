        <p>This artifact is the three-episode adaptation of Franz Kafka’s classic, <em>The Metamorphosis</em>, which my AP Lang (Modern Euro) class created in junior year. It reflects the <b>contemporary, multiliterate scholar</b> attribute, since it required me to first read and analyze the novel in a more typical English-class way in order to understand its deeper meaning. I then had to be a screenwriter, working to stay true to the novel and its themes while also adding a new, original spin to it. Then, as both an actor and a crew member, I had to work with the rest of the class to film our saga in just two and a half classes, coordinating quick set changes and dealing with various mishaps quickly and effectively.<br>This artifact is important to me because it represents not only a chance to work with what we learned in a fun, creative manner, but also a really fun, hilarious time I got to work with my friends to create something vaguely ridiculous. Through the process of creating this adaptation, I gained a (albeit limited) knowledge of how movies and such are filmed, and the work that goes into them. Though I can’t say I’m particularly artistically talented, this relates to my desire to learn more about the artistic process and such.</p>
