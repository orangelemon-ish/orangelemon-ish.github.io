        <h3><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x2j3-CD56BqspFjurqlKM7rkupciYz7E/view?usp=sharing">Adaptation of <em>The Metamorphosis</em></a></h3>
        <p class="thingtxt">This artifact is the three-episode adaptation of Franz Kafka’s classic, <em>The Metamorphosis</em>, which my AP Lang (Modern Euro) class created in junior year. It reflects the <b>contemporary, multiliterate scholar</b> attribute, since it required me to first read and analyze the novel in a more typical English-class way in order to understand its deeper meaning. I then had to be a screenwriter, working to stay true to the novel and its themes while also adding a new, original spin to it. Then, as both an actor and a crew member, I had to work with the rest of the class to film our saga in just two and a half classes, coordinating quick set changes and dealing with various mishaps quickly and effectively.<br><br>This artifact is important to me because it represents not only a chance to work with what we learned in a fun, creative manner, but also a really fun, hilarious time I got to work with my friends to create something vaguely ridiculous. Through the process of creating this adaptation, I gained a (albeit limited) knowledge of how movies and such are filmed, and the work that goes into them. Though I can’t say I’m particularly artistically talented, this relates to my desire to learn more about the artistic process and such.</p>

        <h3>A Record of Now</h3>
        <p class="thingtxt">Throughout my sophomore year, my English teacher had us complete a yearlong project reflecting on life in the midst of a pandemic. This reflection took the form of various kinds of writing, from formal to creative, as well as photography, poetry, and group discussions. This artifact reflects the attribute of <b>balanced, healthy human being</b> because in the process of writing/creating these reflections, I was able to process and come to terms with remote school, missed opportunities, and pandemic life. Over the course of the year, I was able to reflect on pandemic life and move beyond the negative to explore the importance of small things, focusing on the joy still present in the world.<br><br>This artifact is important to me because it was an important means of connection and reflection throughout my sophomore year, where I was fully remote. Through the process of creating this, I was able to reflect and process the situation, as well as try and bring some levity to it. This allowed me to develop my writing skills in several mediums, as well as look more at the positive side of things.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1237TZcoWjAsOdlxWJIClN3b5N3yPPFJvMraHOnFYPYA/edit?usp=sharing">Neurobiology Final Project</a></h3>
        <p class="thingtxt">To cap off my independent study in neurobiology, I chose to explore how time is processed in the human brain. This is a fairly under-researched area, and we don't yet fully understand how exactly people perceive the passage of time, and the fully neural pathways that allow them to do so. In the project, I started out with an exploration of biological clocks, like, and then moved into how the brain experiences the passage of time. I then focused on how time perception is altered during traumatic events, and specifically during the pandemic. This relates to the <b>self-navigating expert learner</b> strand, because I had to learn to sift through dense articles for important information, as well as refine my research skills, as I had to delve into research papers and articles on a relatively less well-documented topic and then synthesize bits and pieces of each source into the final product.<br><br>This artifact is important to me because I was able to explore a topic of my choosing, and present it to a genuinely interested audience in what is simply a fabulous class. (also, my slides is fantastic) While creating this artifact, I improved my research skills and my ability to identify important information. This presentation serves as a demonstration and confirmation of my interest and passion for neuroscience and neurobiology.</p>

        <h3>Gardening</h3>
        <p class="thingtxt">I’ve gardened at the WHS school garden, the Green Teens community garden, and my own personal garden. This process of gardening reflects the strand of <b>courageous, ethical leader</b> in several aspects. I had to balance the process of planning a garden with 10+ separate types of vegetables, all with unique needs in terms of sunlight, spacing, supports, and companion plants with my and my partners’ visions for the garden, and in the case of the community gardens, specific gardening guidelines. I also had to, in each case, lead new gardeners through the process of creating a garden while also respecting the environment and local biodiversity.<br><br>This artifact is important to me because gardening with others, from my partners at community gardens to my family and friends is one of my favorite activities. I also enjoy the challenge of planning a garden and then tending to it. Through the process of gardening, I’ve learned a new patience and sense of wonder in the world. This artifact represents my passion for gardening and nature as a whole.</p>

        <h3>Data Structures Final Project</h3>
        <p class="thingtxt">This artifact is my final project in my Data Structures and Algorithms class - a program which uses the Processing programming application to transmit drawn data between two canvases, including color changes and size differences, effectively creating a shared canvas. This artifact represents the strand of <b>creative, entrepreneurial designer</b> because it required learning new programming structures, including networking and server-client relationships, as well as the creation of graphics. It also represents a risk, because I had never attempted a project like this which would sync between separate devices, and I didn’t know how to work the Processing application.<br><br>This artifact is important to me because it represents an instance where I took a risk beyond what I knew I could do, and succeeded. Over the course of making this program, I learned both new programming structures and a new confidence to take risks without knowing the outcome. This relates to my passion for computer science and coding.</p>
